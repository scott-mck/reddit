# reddit ([Live](http://scottsreddit.herokuapp.com/))

### About:
A site indistinguishable from reddit.com. All post content is provided by
reddit's API and is current and up-to-date. Other content, like the daily gold
progress bar, is not provided by the API and instead uses Nokogiri to fetch and
parse the actual HTML from reddit.

This project makes a great frontend exercise, and I had a lot of fun adding and
styling all the features that reddit employs.

### Features to Implement:
* Creating the users page
* Creating the search page
* Finish the minor features on the comments page
* Finish styling any markdown used in user posts
